## What can I expect from this course?

* This course is research-project-based. As a result, in order to excel at completing all course goals, you will have to spend at least 10 hours of focused work per week on homework and developing your research project.
* Course goals are: to understand, develop, and use deep generative models for audio (and other signals).
* You will demonstrate that you have achieved the course goals by: 
    * Completing a series of homework exercises covering theory and software development for music information retrieval, processing of big datasets, and design and optimization of state-of-the-art deep neural networks
    * Demonstrating knowledge of current research literature in the field by participating in class with insightful, critical, and creative perspectives about the latest developments in the field
    * Conceiving a novel research question and carrying out a high-quality research project using the techniques used in the course
    * Writting a research paper with your research findings
    * Curating a [github](https://github.com/) repository with clear and intuitive code that you used/wrote to develop your research paper
    * Presenting your research project to the class at the end of the semester
* Final grade breakdown
    * 45% Homework\*
    * 45% Final project (code, final presentation, and paper)
    * 10% Participation in class and/or via the [course subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/deeplearningaudio)
* Optional (but recommended if you have excelled at completing all course goals): submit your work to be included in an upcoming peer-reviewed publication, such as
    * [The ISMIR 2022 conference](https://ismir2022.ismir.net/)
    * [DAFX 2022](https://www.dafx.de/)
    * [The Vienna Talk](https://viennatalk2020.mdw.ac.at/)
    * [Special Issue of Computer Music Journal on Challenges and Perspectives of Latin American Computer Music](http://computermusicjournal.org/cmj-latin-america.html)

\*your lowest two homework grades will not be counted toward the final grade.

# Digital audio: review of fundamentals

## Analog-to-digital conversion

* Sounds are pressure waves moving over time and space.

* The movement of pressure waves can be sensed by a membrane (i.e. such as the ones in a microphone) as they move through the membrane.

* The membrane's back-and-forth motions can be "digitized".

* Digitizing involves sampling and quatization.

* A sampling rate comes with its Nyquist limit, which is half the sampling rate. Frequencies above the Nyquist limit will "alias" when digitized.

* Digitization of a "time signal" requires the use of filtering to avoid aliasing of frequency content. 

* Exercise: draw the signal-flow diagram in an analog to digital converter. Include as much detail as possible.

* After proper digitization, we end up with a "time-series" signal with an associated sampling rate, bit depth, and computer number format.

* Stop and think: is the dimensionality of digital audio small or big? What are benefits and pitfalls that result from this? Is digital audio data dense or sparse?

## The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

* Analizing the content of a digital signal is hard in the time domain.

* Very often, the most important content of digital time-domain signals relates to frequencies (i.e. pitch, envelopes, oscillations, etc.). 

* Fortunately, we can use the [DFT](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/st/DFT_Definition.html) to convert a discrete signal (or function) into a complex-valued function of frequency. 

* The DFT is a simple matrix-vector operation (dot product of the finite signal *x(t)* with each row of the complex-valued DFT matrix).

* In the frequency domain, we can measure the magnitude (or energy, usually in decibels) in each of the frequency bins that we obtain after carrying out the DFT.

* Figure 1.2 shows a spectrogram. What is the relationship between a spectrogram and the DFT? (and what about the FFT?)

* Stop and think: does the DFT create or solve issues associated with the dimensionality of digital audio?

# [Homework 1: Digital audio and the DFT](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dl4genaudio/assignments/blob/main/audio_fundamentals_and_the_dft.ipynb)

due Feb 8th at 11:59PM ([Eastern Standard Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/et))

* More things to do:
    * Install in your personal computer a UNIX OS (i.e. [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl)) and become familiar with a apps that are essential for the UNIX development environment (i.e. terminal, bash, pyenv with virtualenv, git).
    * Find and read research papers that align with your interests in the proceedings of conferneces such as [ISMIR 2021](https://ismir2021.ismir.net/papers/), [CogMIR 2019](http://www.cogmir.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CogMIR-2019-Program-Schedule.pdf), [ICASSP 2021](https://www.2021.ieeeicassp.org/2021.ieeeicassp.org/Papers/AcceptedPapers.html), [DAFX 2021](https://dafx2020.mdw.ac.at/proceedings/Proceedings_of_DAFx20in21.html), or do a search on google scholar for keywords that better match your interests within the scope of this course.
